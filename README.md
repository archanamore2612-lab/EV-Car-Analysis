# EV-Car-Analysis

Data-driven analysis of Electric Vehicle specifications (FEV) with Python. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, visual insights, and key performance trends to understand battery range, efficiency, pricing, and brand-wise performance.

## Dataset Overview

-**Source:**  - 'FEV-data-Excel.xlsx'
-**Total Columns:** 25
-**Topics Covered:** Price, Range, Battery Capacity, Power, Torque, Weight, Speed, Brand, Charging Capability

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Clean and standardize raw EV specifications  
- Create informative engineered features  
- Perform basic and advanced exploratory data analysis  
- Visualize key trends across price, brand, and performance  
- Identify outliers and top performers in efficiency and value  
- Extract insights for potential buyers, manufacturers, or investors
